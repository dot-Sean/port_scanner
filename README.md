# port_scanner
Port scanner, written in python

This started off as a simple port scanning tool. However, I have plans to increase its usefulness. 

Version 1.0
-- Simple port scanner

Version 2.0
-- Port scanner linked to a database (MySQL) filled with commonly used ports and their uses. It has evolved from a simple port scanning tool into a simple vulnerability scanner.
